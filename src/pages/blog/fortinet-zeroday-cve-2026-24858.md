If you manage **FortiGate**, **FortiManager**, or **FortiAnalyzer**, a critical authentication bypass in FortiCloud SSO is being actively exploited. Devices patched against the December vulnerabilities are still at risk.

At **Veritium**, we are working with our clients to secure their perimeters immediately. If you need assistance with emergency patching or compromise assessments, please reach out to our team.

---

### ✅ THE FIX: UPGRADE IMMEDIATELY
You must move to these specific versions to secure your perimeter and restore SSO functionality:
* **FortiOS:** 7.6.6+, 7.4.11+, 7.2.13+, or 7.0.19+
* **FortiManager/Analyzer:** 7.6.6+, 7.4.10+, or 7.2.12+

### 🔍 AUDIT YOUR ADMINS & LOGS
Check for these specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) observed in the current wave:

#### Rogue SSO Accounts:
* `cloud-noc@mail.io`
* `cloud-init@mail.io`

#### Rogue Local Admins:
* `audit`, `backup`, `itadmin`, `secadmin`, `support`
* `backupadmin`, `remoteadmin`, `svcadmin`, `system`

#### Suspicious Source IPs:
* `104.28.244.115`, `104.28.212.114`
* `37.1.209.19`, `217.119.139.50`

### 🛠️ IMMEDIATE MITIGATION
If you cannot patch right now, disable FortiCloud SSO login via the CLI:

```bash
config system global
  set admin-forticloud-sso-login disable
end
